This is a collection of defrent protocols keys (host and authentication) that have made their way into software and hardware products. This was inspired by the changeme project.

Keys are split into 11 categories; authorized keys, host keys, references and default ports. The authorized keys can be used to gain access to a device with this public key. The host keys can be used to conduct a MITM attack against the device, but do not provide direct access.
